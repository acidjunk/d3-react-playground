# A small demo for responsive D3 charts in React

Some tests to see how complex it is to get a working setup that can dynamically resize D3 charts in a React App.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Partially copied stuff from: https://medium.com/nightingale/d3-and-react-a-design-pattern-for-responsive-charts-f77337d37ab9

## RESEARCH / TODO:
